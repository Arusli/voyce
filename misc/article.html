        <strong>N</strong>elson Mandela once said, “It is in the character of growth that we should learn from both pleasant and unpleasant experiences.” 
        If that is the case, then how is one to measure the character that develops from an experience that combines both the pleasant and the unpleasant? It is with Mandela’s words in mind that I set forth into the brown eye of the storm, the hairy (and sometimes shorn) wilderness of Brooklyn’s most salacious south-of-the-border neighborhood, Bushwick.
